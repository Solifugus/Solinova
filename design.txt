HiddenCom

A class intended to be run within a browser or on a server (node.js), the 
ultimate goal for HiddenCom is to provide private communication between agents
(any independent actor, such a program or a human).

The following are objectives I will mark off, as they are added:

	[ ] Pluggable identity store.
	[ ] Sharing of key between nodes in the clear yet uninterceptible.
	[ ] Multiple methods of shared-key encryption.
	[ ] Private/Public key encryption.
	[ ] Stenographic cipher/decipher.
	[ ] RESTFul communication
	[ ] TCP/IP socket communication
	[ ] UDP socket communication
